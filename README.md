# pythoncalculator
A simple calculator

Here's my first calculator in python I hope you like it!

You'll also find the code I used to generate it in this (you could write to a file but I wanted to see it right before my own eyes so I used pynput).

I did not copy paste this I geniunely wrote the code and let it execute on my own.
