A simple calculator

Here's my first calculator in python I hope you like it!

You'll also find the code I used to generate it but it crashed after reaching 44 so technically it doesn't work for all integers from 1-100 but it's definitely still something.

I did not copy paste this I geniunely wrote the code and let it execute on my own.
